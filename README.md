# Drum-Kit

A drum kit that includes 7 drum sounds namely:
* The Tom 1 to 4 drums.
* The Snare, Kick and Crash drums.

Assigned to the letters "W", "A", "S", "D", "J", "K" and "L".

When each one is clicked, it creates a little animation that lasts for 0.1 sec. Also makes the sounds assigned to the letters respectively. 
I have also connected the drum kit to the keyboard so that when the precise key is pressed, it makes the corresponding sound assigned to the letters.
